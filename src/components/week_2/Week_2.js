          <h1>Day 9 & 10</h1>
          <p>
            Day 9 and 10 had to do approximately with let&#39;s do approximately
            with working on the machine learning algorithms in learning
            algorithms some of us use outside materials such as outside
            materials such as YouTube Google different books like that is bowl a
            different books like pipeline for outdoors and trading for thing for
            my idea to cloud development and we also and we also worked on
            normalizing most of the information so that when you it&#39;s the
            information so that when you put all the grass on a single scale you
            could see Israel you can see how much the trading strategies would
            differ between them Jesus would differ between them. And then we
            also were using Olive other people&#39;s club using all of other
            people&#39;s code in order to try to measure together so that
            everything worked together so that everything worked and of course
            we had our debugging it&#39;s a debugging area that we win through
            as a way of trying to Make sure the entire project was working on
            everyone&#39;s computer.
          </p>
          <p>
            This park could be sometimes challenging because the way we edit
            code and change the code affects other people&#39;s Versions of the
            code differently such as having files and youth jazz having files in
            different places and locating them and just having them all around
            I&#39;m just having them all around standard of cold nerd of cold we
            can all jump into at any point kind of be OK with point kind of be
            OK with. So here&#39;s just a good example of when you just need to
            do a team coding and Really look at errors and errors and try to
            help everybody else get to the same comfortable postion
          </p>

          <h1>Day 11 & 12</h1>
          <p>
            So in this area we started realizing that the project time was
            almost off and project time was almost up and that we had to try to
            simplify this project simplify this project even more to try to make
            sure that we were able to try to make sure that we were able to at
            least finish on time period. So we had some basic idea of machine
            learning and using that in order to get a price and using that in
            order to get a price I&#39;ve also had other versions of it that
            were a way at other versions of it that were just to give us CSV
            file of a price is of a price the asset symbol the asset symbol
            andWhether or not it was a buy or a sell I&#39;m supposed to doing
            strong by and strong it&#39;s a strong buy and strong sale and
            making it up a little bit more complicated it&#39;s a little bit
            more complicated and also putting in for quantity as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The The last part we saved for the end was to actually start making
            the bot and what we did making the bot and what we try to do is make
            a bot class that called the it&#39;s class that called the alpaca
            API from whatever county was from whatever count it was you know
            connected to at the time and made a trade yeah and made a trade
            based off what was in ACS they stopped what was in CSV file the
            first If Porsche was OK and which the code actually makes the trade
            is pretty simple An execute with no problem as well as giving the
            data on your Current account status. By the way this is also using
            alpaca API paper which has been very helpful in testing.
          </p>
          <h1>Day 13 & 14</h1>
          <p>
            {" "}
            The The last couple of days was spent actually making the website is
            making the website making the powerpoint fixing up our read fixing
            up our read me and more sober towards presentation towards
            presentation. The other the other stuff that we were trying to get
            working was the working with polygate it was the working with
            polygon which was something that we needed in order to needed in
            order to get the current market data Consistently and then make
            trades based off whatever the price is right now at this point.This
            proved to be a bit difficult because anything using polygon was a
            bit out of date there&#39;s a bit out of date since alpaca and
            polygon don&#39;t ask since alpaca and polygon don&#39;t actually
            work together anymore and and polygon using it up itself
            wasDifficult because the entire information On how to use polygon
            wasn&#39;t readily available for the way that we were intending to
            use it.We had a general information but I was unable to consistently
            get the information let&#39;s get the information every minute to
            try and update my track made my trades ignore which proved to be the
            the main issue.
